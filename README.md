# Task-cli project
## Source.
I took the project idea from https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker, and I'm happy I did
## Usage.
* To run the script in the Command-line mode run `python -m task-cli <command> [args]`<br>
If the `command` is empty defaults to `help`. if the `args` is empty and needed shows the command signature
* To run the script in the Interface mode run `python -m task-cli run`<br>
Interface mode is the same as command-line mode except you don't have to write the `python -m task-cli` prefix everytime<br>
To exit the interface mode enter `exit` or `quit` command
